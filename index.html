     <!----------- WHAT I LEARNT AS AN RA -------------->
    <section class = "ques1" id = "ques1">
        <h1>WHAT I LEARNT AS AN RA</h1>
        <p>Over the course of 2 terms being an RA, I have grown a lot as a person and team member. Here are a few significant areas I have seen growth in. </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="one-col">
                <h3> Career Preparedness</h3>
                <p>"As I am in the early stages of my professional career, I have gained many skills that are essential in a professional environment. Alongside the networking opportunities that come with being an RA, I have learnt how to communicate professionally, be a leader, and organize my community to bring everyone together."
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="one-col">
                <h3> Inclusivity and Open-Mindedness</h3>
                <p>"Interacting with students from all around the world, as an RA, I got the opportunity to learn about people from a unique point of view: their living environment. I love to learn about how no two people live in the same way. Residents express their cultures, habits, backgrounds in creative ways."
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="one-col">
                <h3> My strengths lie in supporting upperclassmen students</h3>
                <p>"As I enter my junior year, I wish to support upperclassmen students excel in their professional careers and deal with stresses that come alongside being juniors and seniors. Walking on my path to securing an internship, I gained skills necessary to succeed in the job market that I wish to share with others."

        <h1>CHALLENGES I FACED</h1>
        <p1>Alongside learning come obstacles. Through the challenges I encountered, there is a lot I learnt. Here are some fields I struggled in orignally, but now have found ways to excel in the same fields.</p1>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="rowques3">
                <img src="images/time.png">
                <h3>Time Management</h3>
                <p>Balancing responsibilites is an essential skill an RA must have. I have found ways to organize my schedule such as using a Google Calendar so that I find time for 1 on 1s, interacting with my residents, and being on duty. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="rowques3">

                <h3>Dealing with Stressful Situations</h3>
                <p>Learning how to deescalate stressful situation is something that I had to learn. My best advice would be to respond, and not react! I am now confident in my abilities to tackle any situation I encounter as well as aid other CAs in doing the same. </p>
            </div>

                <h3>Setting boundaries with residents</h3>
                <p>As much as I wish to support my residents, sometime for my peace and safety, I have to put myself first. I wish to offer myself fully, but whenever I can not, I find ways to draw a boundary. </p>

        <h1>ADVICE FOR INCOMING RAs FROM ME AND FELLOW CAs</h1>
        <p1>I asked my friends, who are current RAs, to give their words of wisdom to future RAs. This is what they had to say. Notice how they all rate the RA experience 5 starts :)</p1>
